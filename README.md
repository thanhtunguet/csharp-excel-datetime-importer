# 📅 C# Excel DateTime Importer

> **A tiny demo to prove that handling date values from Excel in C# is not rocket science.**

---

## 📖 Overview

This repository was created solely to demonstrate that **handling various date formats from Excel files in C#** is entirely feasible — despite what certain backend developers might have you believe.  
After a long and passionate debate about how "impossible", "tricky", and "unsafe" this simple task might be, we decided to settle it the proper way: with code.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend:** C# (.NET 6.0) + Entity Framework Core  
- **Frontend:** React + Ant Design + TypeScript + Vite + TailwindCSS  
- **Bonus:** Monaco Editor for displaying the C# implementation right in the browser (because why not?).

---

## 🎯 Features

- ✅ Import Excel files containing:
  - Standard date formats
  - Serial numbers (e.g., `45123` = `2023-07-15`)
  - Plain text dates (like `15/07/2023`)
  
- ✅ Convert and handle those values cleanly in C#

- ✅ Frontend allows:
  - Uploading an Excel file
  - Viewing the C# code responsible for this magical feat right in a Monaco Editor window

## 💬 Why This Exists

Because someone on the backend team kept listing an endless array of reasons why this couldn't (or shouldn't) be done.  
Rather than argue, we chose violence… in the form of a proof-of-concept repo.

## 📦 How to Run

Coming soon (if they don't find a new excuse).
